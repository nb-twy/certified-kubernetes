# Test Cluster Setup
It's important to be able to set up a test cluster to play with, tear down, stand up again.  There are
tools you can use to set up test clusters like minikube and Docker Desktop.  There is even a way to setup
a completely containerized cluster.  I am working on a configuration using multiple VMs, which is closer
to how you would establish a cluster in production.
